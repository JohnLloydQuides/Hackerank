Purpose:
Counts the number of integers that are multiples of all elements in array a and factors of all elements in array b.

How it Works:
Starts with the first element of a (a[0]) and checks its multiples (a[0] * index) up to b[0].
For each candidate number:
Checks if it is divisible by every element in the rest of a (cloneA).
Checks if every element in b is divisible by this candidate.
If both conditions are true, increments the result counter.
Returns the total count.
