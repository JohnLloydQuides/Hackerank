Counts the number of "beautiful days" between i and j (inclusive).
A day is beautiful if the absolute difference between the day and its reverse is divisible by k.

How it Works:

Loop through each day from i to j.
Reverse the digits of the day.
Calculate the absolute difference between the day and its reversed value.
If this difference is divisible by k, increment the count.
Return the total count.
