Read the grid:

The grid is a list of strings, each string representing a row of digits.

Convert to a mutable format:

Strings are immutable, so convert each row to an array of characters for easy editing.

Loop through the grid:

Skip the border rows and columns (i.e., start from index 1 and go to n - 2).

For each cell, compare its value to its four neighbors.

Check for cavity:

If the current cell is greater than top, bottom, left, and right neighbors, mark it as 'X'.

Return the modified grid:

Convert each row back to a string and return the final list.
